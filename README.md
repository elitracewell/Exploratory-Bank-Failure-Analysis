# Banks in Distress: Analyzing the Regions of US Bank Failures

This repository contains information on the trends of bank failures in the United States between the years 1975 and 2020. The data was collected from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and analyzed to determine the causes and states most impacted by the bank failures.

# Causes of Bank Failures

The data showed that the largest spikes of bank failures occurred between the years 1975 to 1995 and 2000 to 2020. The causes of the significant number of bank failures from 1975 to 1995 were high interest rates and inflation. The Southwest region, especially Texas, experienced the highest impact of bank failures because they invested a substantial amount of money into the oil industry. During this time, oil prices considerably increased and then dropped due to supply and demand. For example, when the banks invested $27 per barrel into oil, within just a few years, prices per barrel dropped below $10. The top few states impacted by this were Texas, California, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Illinois.

The cause of the significant amount of bank failures during 2000 to 2020 was driven by the financial crisis in 2007 to 2009 known as the “Great Recession”. The housing market crashed, housing prices were on the rise, banks continued to lend, and people could not afford to make their payments. The top few states impacted by this were Georgia, Florida, Illinois, California, and Michigan.

# States Most Impacted
The highest cost of failures happened in Texas with over 10 million dollars. This was due to Texas making most of their investments in the oil industry. California followed, losing about 1.5 million dollars, then Louisiana, Florida, and Arizona. The highest bank failures occurred heavily in the south versus the north.

# Predicting Future Bank Failures
We were able to use this data to determine that during any given year, when there is an increase of fifteen or more bank closures, it is highly likely that more bank closures will follow.

# Conclusion
This repository provides insights into the trends and causes of bank failures in the United States between the years 1975 and 2020. The data suggests that banks should be cautious about investing in industries that are prone to price volatility, such as oil. Additionally, regulators should be vigilant when there is an increase of fifteen or more bank closures in any given year.
